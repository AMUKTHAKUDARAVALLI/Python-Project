**Train Dataset Analysis**

This project involves analyzing a train crash dataset using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The goal is to clean the dataset, explore it, and build machine learning models to predict survival.

**Dataset Overview**:

The dataset contains ~891 records with missing values.

The target variable is Survived (1 = survived, 0 = died).

**Tasks & Solutions:**

**Data Cleaning**: Remove unwanted/missing records and report the remaining count.

**Most Frequent Embarkation Station**: Identify the station with the highest passenger count.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use head(), info(), describe(), nunique(), etc., and exclude irrelevant features.

**Outlier Detection & Treatment**: Identify and handle outliers.

**Data Partitioning**: Split data into 70% training and 30% testing sets (random_state=12345).

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model**: Determine the best k, evaluate accuracy.

**Logistic Regression Model**: Build and assess accuracy.

**Decision Tree Model**: Determine optimal depth and analyze accuracy.

**Best Model Selection**: Compare KNN and Logistic Regression and justify the choice.

**Data Visualization**: Generate insightful graphs to describe the dataset.

**Implementation Approach**:

Developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook (Q2_Train.ipynb).

Utilized pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

Applied best programming practices for clear output and intuitive user interaction.
